Welcome to DaPoker!
This version of poker supports only 2 human players
The humans will play their turn one by one on the same machine
The humans will have to enter their names at the beginning
Each player will be given 100 ADA tokens to start with
At the beginning of each round, a total of 5 community cards will be dealt
along with 2 cards to each player at random
The game will start with a small blind of 1 ADA and a big blind of 2 ADA
For simplicity the first player will be the small blind and the second player will be the big blind
This means that the game will start with the first player's turn
Each player has the option to fold, call, check, raise or perform allin
In this primitive version, there are no side pots, the winner takes all
